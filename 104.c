// rite a Program to take a positive integer n as input, and find the pivot integer x such that the sum of all elements between 1 and x inclusively equals the sum of all elements between x and n inclusively. Print the pivot integer x. If no such integer exists, print -1. Assume that it is guaranteed that there will be at most one pivot integer for the given input.

#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    int n, x;
    int total, left, right;

    scanf("%d", &n);

    total = n * (n + 1) / 2;

    for (x = 1; x <= n; x++)
    {
        left = x * (x + 1) / 2;
        right = total - (x - 1) * x / 2;

        if (left == right)
        {
            printf("%d", x);
            return 0;
        }
    }

    printf("-1");

    return 0;
}
